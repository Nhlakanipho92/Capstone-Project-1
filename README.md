Finance Calculator 
Description
The 'Finance Calculator' project is a program written in Python that was created to fulfill the level 1 compulsory task requirements as set in the Hyperion Development Software Engineering Bootcamp that I am enrolled in. This program was designed for use by a small financial company, to allow them access to two different financial calculators namely; an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

Functionality
When run, this program firstly displays a menu to the user with two options of finance calculators they can access (i.e. investment calculator or bond/ home loan repayment calculator). Depending on which calculator the user chooses, the program will then prompt the user for input with a series of questions, which will capture the information needed to calculate either their total investment value over a certain number of years, or their monthly bond repayments for a set time period. For example, if the user chooses the investment calculator, they will be asked to enter the initial deposit amount, interest rate, number of years they plan to invest for, as well as whether they wish to invest with simple or compound interest. The program will then calculate the final investment value based on the user's input and display the results in an easy-to-read, informative sentence. The same process is followed if the user chooses the home loan repayment calculator except that they will be asked for relevant input to calculate their monthly bond repayments (i.e. house value, interest rate and number of months planned to repay the bond).

Usefulness
This program is useful because it displays a relatively simple, straighforward Python program that can get user input and calculate their desired option for output in an efficient, clear manner. The code is also well commented on so that anyone running or reading the program can follow and understand each step of the process.

Contributors
This project was worked on individually by myself as a student in the software engineering bootcamp. However, it has been reviewed and commented on by the helpful mentors from Hyperion Development!
